/*

useEffect is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in your functional components, such as fetching data, manually changing the DOM, or setting up subscriptions.(these shouldnâ€™t happen directly inside the render - bcoz render happens like every ms and it should be like just simple calculations and return UI) It runs after every render by default but can be controlled with a dependency array. - when state changes, u want to do something side ways then useEffect

-  - whenever componenet re-renders
[] - only 1 time when component mounts
[var] - whenever these variable changes
